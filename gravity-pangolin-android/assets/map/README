******** HOW TO MAKE A MAP ********

	+ The map file must have .pm extension.
	+ On top of the file are different options:
		PANGOLINDIR : Our Pangolin's direction when the game starts (0 (LEFT), 1 (UP), 2 (RIGHT), 3 (DOWN))
		FINISHDIR : The finish spot's direction (0 (LEFT), 1 (UP), 2 (RIGHT), 3 (DOWN))
		MAPSIZE : The size of the map you are drawing, considering one symbol per unit
	+ Then comes the map itself which is designed using different symbols as for:
		X : block
		S : start point
		E : exit spot
		O : gravity changer
