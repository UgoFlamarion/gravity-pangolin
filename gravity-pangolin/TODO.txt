--------- FIRST THINGS FIRST ----------
- All pangolin sprite need to have the same size
--------- ////////////////// ----------

[?] The Animations (ie. for Pangolin) need to be children classes of EntityAnimation (which needs to be implemented)
		OR
[?] Should I use Scene2D with Stages and Actors instead of Entities ? (http://www.netthreads.co.uk/2012/01/31/libgdx-example-of-using-scene2d-actions-and-event-handling/)

[DONE] Use the SpriteLoader everywhere it's needed
[DONE] Set the texture for every sprite
[DONE] Cannot put blocks on the map at first line
[DONE] The controller is buggy -> press falling direction's arrow when inverting gravity
[DONE] Make GravityPangolinScreen implements ScreenAbstract and do the adjustments
[DONE] Every entities (even blocks) must extend (or implement) a superclass/abstract/interface
